# Franklin BBQ

This project is a concept mobile application, used as a learning project, but may be pitched to FranklinBBQ for real use.

In Austin, [Franklin BBQ](https://franklinbbq.com/) is a famous BBQ restaurant, with daily lines around the block. The app is conceptualized to support Franklin's day-to-day inventory management and order taking. Much of their BBQ takes several hours to make, so they often have limited quantities available each day.

The application is built with the following technologies:

  * Front-end: React Native & Firebase
  * Back-end: Python (Microservice)
    * Infrastructure: Google App Engine
  * Database: Google Firestore
